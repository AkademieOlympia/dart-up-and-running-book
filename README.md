Project Structure
-----------------

**Makefile:**
	Use this to run doc-code-merge and to test the code.

**README.md:**
	This file.

**book.xml:**
	This is the entry point for the book, from an XML point of view.

**code/:**
	Code should be pulled out of the XML files and put here.

**figs/:**
	Figures and images.

**merged/:**
	doc-code-merge merges the documentation in xml/ and the code in code/
	to create this directory. It is autogenerated, so do not modify it!

**xml/:**
	The DocBook source for the book.


Using the Makefile
------------------

Install the Dart Editor (or Dart SDK).

Define DART_SDK, perhaps in your ~/.bashrc. Be sure to fill in the "..." with
the actual place you put it:

	export DART_SDK=.../dart-sdk
	export PATH=$PATH:$DART_SDK/bin

Checkout a copy of doc-code-merge:

	git clone git@github.com:dart-lang/doc-code-merge.git
	cd doc-code-merge
	pub install

Make sure you put that in your PATH as well, perhaps in your ~/.bashrc. Be
sure to fill in the "..." with the actual place you downloaded doc-code-merge:

	export PATH=$PATH:.../doc-code-merge

Install packages:

  cd .../doc-code-merge
  pub install

Now, just run make from your SVN directory:

	make

Watch the output carefully for errors. Unfortunately, there are cases where it
will print an error but not stop processing.
