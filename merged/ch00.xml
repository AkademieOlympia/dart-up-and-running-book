    <title>Using code examples</title>

    <para>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, you may
    use the code in this book in your programs and documentation. You do not
    need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant
    portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several
    chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or
    distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require
    permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example
    code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of
    example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require
    permission.</para>

    <para>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution
    usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example:
    “<emphasis>Book Title</emphasis> by Some Author (O’Reilly). Copyright 2012
    Some Copyright Holder, 978-0-596-xxxx-x.”</para>

    <para>If you feel your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the
    permission given above, feel free to contact us at
    <email>permissions@oreilly.com</email>.</para>

    <title>Acknowledgments</title>

    <para>We’d like to thank the many people who contributed to this book. We
    hope we haven’t forgotten anyone, but we probably have.</para>

    <para>The following Dart engineers and managers gave us prompt, helpful
    reviews of the sections corresponding to their areas of responsibility:
    Mads Ager, Peter von der Ahé, Justin Fagnani, Dan Grove, Florian Loitsch,
    Sam McCall, Vijay Menon, John Messerly, Anton Muhin, Lasse R.H. Nielsen,
    Bob Nystrom, Ivan Posva, and Jaime Wren.</para>

    <para>We’d especially like to thank the people who reviewed even bigger
    swaths of the book or contributed in other, large ways:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JJ Behrens, whose careful look at the first draft of the book
        helped us catch errors and inconsistencies, as well as rework Chapter
        5 to be more interesting, and less of a laundry list. He also created
        a system for testing our samples, so we can be sure that they work now
        and continue to work as the language and libraries evolve.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Shailen Tuli, who helped test our examples, although he doesn’t
        even work for Google.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Mary Campione, whose stream-of-consciousness review of the
        entire book, performed while she was first learning the language,
        helped us find and fix many confusing spots, as well as some errors.
        Phil Quitslund, who did a big-picture review of the book and gave us
        guidance and encouragement.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Kasper Lund, whose review caught issues that only someone with
        his expert, comprehensive knowledge of the Dart language and libraries
        could have found.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Gilad Bracha, the language spec writer whose reviews of the
        language chapter (our longest one) were invaluable for getting
        language details right. We couldn’t cover everything, so we look
        forward to his future work on making the nuances of the language
        understandable to all Dart programmers.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Other Googlers helped, as well. Vivian Li, the head of Chrome
    Developer Relations, supported our work on this book. Andres Ferrate, the
    Google Press liaison to O’Reilly, helped simplify the process of getting
    the book published. Myisha Harris gave us excellent legal advice.</para>

    <para>The people at O’Reilly were extremely helpful. Meghan Blanchette,
    our editor, kept everything going smoothly, monitoring our progress in the
    nicest possible way. We’d also like to thank the good people who manage
    the author workflow and make working on an O'Reilly book such a pleasure.
    We personally worked with Sarah Schneider and Jessica Hosman.</para>

    <para>Finally, we thank Lars Bak and Kasper Lund for writing the foreword,
    and most of all for creating Dart.</para>
